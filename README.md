### 4. Set Up Speaker Diarization (Optional)

1. Create a HuggingFace account at [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/join)
2. Get your access token:
   - Go to [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
   - Create new token with 'read' access (specifically, 'Read access to contents of all public gated repos you can access' under 'Repositories' - this makes sure that you can use Pyannote, below)
3. Accept the model terms:
   - Visit [pyannote/speaker-diarization](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization)
   - Visit [pyannote/segmentation](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation)
   - Click "Accept" on both model pages
4. Enter your token in Scribey's Settings tab

## Usage

1. Launch the application:
   ```bash
   python Scribey.py
   ```

2. Add files:
   - Click "Add Files" or drag-and-drop
   - Supported formats: mp3, wav, m4a, mp4, avi, mov, mkv, webm

3. Configure options:
   - Select Whisper model (tiny to large)
   - Enable/disable speaker diarization
   - Choose output format

4. Click "Start Transcription"

## Technical Details

### Large File Processing

Scribey uses smart chunking for processing large files:
- Audio files are automatically split into 30-minute segments
- Each segment is processed independently
- Results are merged seamlessly
- Speakers are tracked consistently across chunks
- Memory usage is optimized for large files

This approach allows Scribey to handle files of any length while maintaining consistent speaker identification and transcription quality.

### Output Format

The transcript is formatted with clear speaker separation:
```
SPEAKER 1
This is the first speaker talking.

SPEAKER 2
This is the second speaker responding.
```

Optional timestamps can be included:
```
SPEAKER 1
[0.00s - 2.34s] This is the first speaker talking.

SPEAKER 2
[2.34s - 4.56s] This is the second speaker responding.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **FFmpeg Not Found**:
   - Verify FFmpeg is installed: `ffmpeg -version`
   - Check if it's in your system PATH
   - Try reinstalling FFmpeg

2. **Speaker Diarization Issues**:
   - Verify your HuggingFace token
   - Ensure you've accepted both model terms
   - For large files, expect longer processing times
   - GPU acceleration is recommended but not required

3. **Memory Issues**:
   - The application automatically manages memory for large files
   - Consider using a smaller Whisper model for faster processing
   - For very large files, the chunking system will handle processing automatically

### Performance Tips:

1. **Model Selection**:
   - tiny: Fastest, lowest accuracy
   - base: Good balance (recommended)
   - small: Better accuracy, slower
   - medium: High accuracy, slower
   - large: Best accuracy, slowest

2. **Processing Time**:
   - Transcription: ~0.3-0.5x audio duration with GPU
   - Diarization: ~0.3-2x audio duration depending on hardware
   - Total time varies based on file length and chosen options
