# Speaker Diarization Setup

Speaker diarization requires additional setup:

Create a HuggingFace account at https://huggingface.co/join
Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
Create a new Access Token with 'read' role
Accept the user conditions for both models:

Visit https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization
Visit https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation


Add your token in the app's Settings tabg

# Supported File Formats

Audio: mp3, wav, m4a
Video: mp4, avi, mov, mkv, webm
YouTube URLs

# Common Issues & Solutions

FFmpeg not found:

Ensure FFmpeg is installed and in system PATH
Restart application after installation

Diarization not working:

Verify HuggingFace token is valid
Ensure you've accepted terms for both models
Check internet connection
Try alternative diarization method if primary fails

YouTube download fails:

Check internet connection
Verify URL is valid and video is accessible
Update yt-dlp: pip install -U yt-dlp

### Speaker Diarization Issues on Windows

If you encounter permission errors with speaker diarization:

1. First method: Run the application as administrator
2. Second method: Disable and re-enable speaker diarization
3. If both fail, you can:
   - Continue without speaker diarization
   - Try processing smaller audio files
   - Use the basic transcription and add speaker labels manually

Note: The diarization feature works best with:
- Clear audio quality
- Limited background noise
- Distinct speaker voices
- Audio files under 30 minutes
